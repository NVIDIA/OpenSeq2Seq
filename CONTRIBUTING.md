* Before merging, your PR will have to go through code review by us.

We use [Google Python Code Style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md), so make sure to run pylint over your code (pylint config is located in the `.pylintrc` file in the root of OpenSeq2Seq) and check that the score is >= 8.0. We also recommend using [GIT Pylint Commit Hook](https://git-pylint-commit-hook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) to automate this process.

Thanks for contributing!
