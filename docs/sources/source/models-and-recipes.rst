Models and recipes
==================


.. note::
    Currently OpenSeq2Seq has model implementations for machine translation and
    automatic speech recognition.
    All models work both in float32 and mixed precision.
    We recommend you use :ref:`mixed precision training <mixed_precision>`
    when training on Volta GPUs.


To train models you can use the following commands (don't forget to substitute
valid config_file path there and number of GPUs if using Horovod).

With Horovod (highly recommended when using multiple GPUs)::

    mpiexec --allow-run-as-root -np <num_gpus> python run.py --config_file=... --mode=train_eval --use_horovod=True --enable_logs

Without Horovod::

    python run.py --config_file=... --mode=train_eval --enable_logs

The description of implemented models is available in the next sections:

Machine translation
-------------------

The table below contains description and results of
machine translation models available in OpenSeq2Seq.
Currently, we have GNMT-based model, Transformer-based models and
ConvS2S-based models.

We measure BLEU score on newstest2014.tok.de file using ``multi-bleu.perl`` script from Mosses.
For more details about model descriptions and training setup,
have a look at the `configuration files <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenSeq2Seq/blob/master/example_configs/text2text/en-de>`_.

Speech recognition
------------------

The table below contains description and results of
speech recognition models available in OpenSeq2Seq.
Currently, we have DeepSpeech2-based models and Wav2Letter-based models.

WER is the word error rate obtained on a dev-clean subset of LibriSpeech using
greedy decoder (``decoder_params/use_language_model = False``).
For the final evaluation we used ``batch_size_per_gpu = 1``
to eliminate the effect of `cudnn padding issue <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenSeq2Seq/issues/69>`_.
For more details about model descriptions and training setup,
have a look at the `configuration files <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenSeq2Seq/blob/master/example_configs/speech2text>`_.
