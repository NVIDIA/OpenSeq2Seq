################
Getting started 
################

The current tacotron 2 implementation supports the 
`LJSpeech <https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/>`_ dataset and the
`MAILABS <http://www.m-ailabs.bayern/en/the-mailabs-speech-dataset/>`_ dataset.
For more details about the model including hyperparameters and tips, see 
:doc:`Tacotron-2 </speech-synthesis/tacotron-2>`.

It is recommended to start with the LJSpeech dataset to familiarize yourself
with the data layer.

********
Get data
********

First, you need to download and extract the dataset into a directory of your
choice. The extracted file should consist of a metadata.csv file and a directory
of wav files. metadata.csv lists all the wav filename and their corresponding
transcripts delimited by the '|' character.


********
Training
********

Next let's train a tacotron 2 model. For this: 

* change ``dataset_location`` under to point to the directory containing the metadata.csv file.
* rename ``metadata.csv`` to ``train.csv``

Start training::

    python run.py --config_file=example_configs/text2speech/tacotron_LJ_float.py --mode=train

If your GPU does not have enough memory, reduce the ``batch_size_per_gpu``
parameter.

***********
Inference
***********

Once training is done (this can take a while on a single GPU), you can run
inference. To do some, first create a csv file named ``test.csv`` in the same
location as ``train.csv`` with lines in the following format::

    UNUSED | UNUSED | This is an example sentence that I want to generate.

You can put as many lines inside the csv as you want. The model will produce
one audio sample per line and save the audio sample inside your ``log_dir``.
Lastly, run ::

    python run.py --config_file=example_configs/text2speech/tacotron_LJ_float.py --mode=infer --infer_output_file=unused
