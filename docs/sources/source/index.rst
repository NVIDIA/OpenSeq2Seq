OpenSeq2Seq
===========

OpenSeq2Seq is a TensorFlow-based toolkit for training sequence-to-sequence models:

 * :ref:`machine translation <machine_translation>` (GNMT, Transformer, ConvS2S, ...)
 * :ref:`speech recognition <speech_recognition>` (DeepSpeech2, Wave2Letter, ...)
 * :ref:`speech synthesis <speech_synthesis>` (Tacotron2, ...)
 * :ref:`language model <language_model>` (LSTM, ...)
 * :ref:`sentiment analysis <sentiment_analysis>` (SST, IMDB, ...)

**Main features**:

* modular architecture to allows easily assembling of new models from available components
* support for mixed-precision training, that utilizes Tensor Cores introduced in NVIDIA Volta GPUs 
* fast, simple-to-use, Horovod-based distributed training and data parallelism, supporting both multi-GPU and multi-node

To install this toolkit, look at :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`.
Next go to :ref:`in-depth tutorials <in_depth>` section. 
You can also find some useful information in the :ref:`mixed precision  <mixed_precision>` and
:ref:`distributed training <distributed_training>` sections.
